# Portfolio_Prototype
A website prototype for my portfolio


This a website I am creating using what I have been taught at university as well as content I am teaching myself. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
I hope to design and create a website that reflects my creativity and ambition.


Whereas a CV is quite condensed, the aim of this portfolio is to be able to go into further detail than can be obtained from a CV and showcase 
more skills that employers may be looking for.
