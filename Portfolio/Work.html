                            A two week work experience with Nettleship Sawyer Chartered Surveyors. This work experience was my first look at the working world and saw me shadowing
                            surveyors, designing floor plans and creating building portfolios.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had quite a lot of independence and this first working experience allowed me to learn key time management and professionalism skills.

                        <p>I worked as a waiter at Snowtrax Alpine Centre for two years.
                        During this time, I my responsibilities were to deliver food to customers, take care of Kitchen Porter duties and set up/clear away the restaurant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was my first experience with customer relations, and I learnt to communicate with the customers so that they felt they had received excellent service.
                            Having to deliver food, maintain the kitchen and assist customers also meant learning how to prioritise my tasks in the most efficient manner possible.

                        <p>
                            Working as a lifeguard at New Milton Health and Leisure has been my most challenging role in a workplace.
                            My responsibilities include ensuring customer safety, performing successful rescues and carrying out operational duties around the leisure centre.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also learnt how to work effectively in a team with good communication and efficiency as these skills are critical in a rescue.
                            Alongside this, a lifeguard needs to be able to remain calm and think clearly in dangerous situations in order to administer fast but correct first aid.
                        </p>

                        <p>In 2016 I was promoted to a Senior Lifeguard at New Milton Health and Leisure. In addition to my regular lifeguard responsibilities,
                        I now supervise the team of lifeguards on shift, ensuring they are carrying out their duties correctly and delegating any operational tasks that need to be done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This role has strengthened my skills in leading a team by motivating them, setting an example and using excellent communication skills.
                            As a senior lifeguard I am also expected to be the first to respond to emergencies across the centre with a rapid response and effective treatments.
